              <p>
                Yes!<br/><br/>
                Use as much or as little as you want. Maybe you want to sketch out ideas for
                dialogue or story by using flow charts. Or, maybe you just want to spitball a
                couple ideas by writing them down in plain text on digital index cards. It's
                all up to you!
